    <p>LibRedirect offers the following Keyboard shortcuts for easier access</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>Shift+Alt+L</code> - To Switch the instance you are currently in
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>Shift+Alt+C</code> - Copies the original link. Ex: Copies the original Twitter link when you are in
        Nitter website
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>Shift+Alt+O</code> - Redirects to original Site from the frontend
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>Shift+Alt+R</code> - Redirects from Original Site to the frontend.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some shortcuts may or may not work in certain browsers such as Microsoft Edge.</p>
    <h3 id="preferred"><a href="#preferred">Preferred Instances</a></h3>
    <p>To go from a current instance you are using to your preferred or favorite instance, it is explained as follows.
      For example, assume that you receive a piped link shared to you which is of the instance <a
        href="https://piped.mha.fi">piped.mha.fi</a> but you want to use your favorite instance that is <a
        href="https://piped.video">piped.video</a>, The Official instance. It will be a hassle to change the particular
      part of domain if there is a lot of similar links which may become a big discomfort for you.
    </p>
    <p>To avoid that hassle you can redirect to your favorite instance within few clicks, just two !!, just open the
      popup menu and click the reload button near the frontend. In this case, YouTube. Voila !, you have reached your
      destination.</p>

    <p> Below is a small demo of this feature. Note that, Switching to favorite instance by clicking the reload button
      works depsite the redirection for the frontend is turned off or on.</p>

    <p><b>Note : </b> Some frontends may not have this feature. But the popular and mostly used ones do have them. We
      will try to expand the functionality if it is feasible.</p>
    <h3 id="exceptions"><a href="#exceptions">Exceptions</a></h3>
    <div><img class="align" src="img/docs/exceptions.webp" alt="Image of Exceptions settings"></div>
    <p>Exceptions as the name says for itself will exclude certain sites from being redirected.
      When you add a site to the exceptions list it will not redirect as it is excluded from redirection.</p>
    <p>This exceptions list is an allowlist <b>NOT</b> a blocklist.</p>
    <h3 id="instances"><a href="#instances">Defined Instances</a></h3>
    <p> You should be able to see instances such as <span class="color-c">
        Cloudflare</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="color-c">Cloudflare:</span> indicates that an instances is using Cloudflare as it's CDN.
      Cloudflare basically decrypts the data between you and the instance to compress it to send it faster, a <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a> basically.
      In other words, Cloudflare can see your data in Plain text even with HTTPS. So, use these instances carefully.
