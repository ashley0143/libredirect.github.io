    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3 id="why_libredirect"><a href="#why_libredirect">Why LibRedirect?</a></h3>
    <p>Normally you watch YouTube videos through <a>youtube.com</a>'s server. Problem is everything
      you watch is tied to your Google Account. Even if you don't use an account, your IP address is still visible.
      Even if you used <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>, you still have <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> enabled, a programming language that can get so
      much information about your browser and your system which is a little creepy. Just go to <a
        href="https://deviceinfo.me">deviceinfo.me</a> or <a href="https://www.amiunique.org">amiunique.org</a> and see
      how much information is available to know about you.<br></p>
    <p>So, why not disabling JavaScript? Great idea! Now YouTube is broken as it requires JavaScript to function
      ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
    <p>There's a way though to make a script that scraps data off of <a>youtube.com</a> and presents
      it in a nice simple webpage that doesn't require JavaScript. People have done this already! There's a project
      called <a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious">Invidious</a> that doesn't require JavaScript for you to
      watch YouTube videos, ex: <a href=https://yewtu.be/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ>https://yewtu.be/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
    </p>
    <p>Those (Invidious and others) are called alternative <span class="yellow">Frontends</span>, where you really are
      still using YouTube but with a different Interface, in our case a privacy friendly one.<br></p>
    <p>
      Using a frontend and changing links each time from ex:<br>
      <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
      <span>&#8594;</span>
      <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://yewtu.be/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
      <br> is a difficult process and best to be automated, so we did that!<br>
    </p>
    <p>LibRedirect's main functionality is to make the use of those frontends easier by automating it. It makes life
      much easier and privacy more convenient.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect">Privacy Redirect</a>
      hasn't been maintained since 6/12/2021. Many instances are hard coded.
      Some should be removed as they became offline and many others should be
      added. Many Pull Requests were left pending and waiting. So we stepped
      in. Later, we started improving it further by adding new features and
      frontends.
    </p>

    <p>
      Disclaimer: Even though we forked from Privacy Redirect, LibRedirect is
      ahead of the main project with several improvements and new features.
      LibRedirect is independent now.

    <h3 id="why_all_those_permissions">
      <a href="#why_all_those_permissions">Why all those permissions?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Let's examine them one by one:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest">webRequest</a>,
        <a>webRequestBlocking</a>: To block <code>http</code> requests or
        redirect them. For example, to redirect to Invidious before it can
        reach YouTube's servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage">storage</a>: To
        save LibRedirect's settings permanently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText">Clipboard.writeText</a>:
        To write the original link to the clipboard while using Copy Raw.
        This permission is used to only write data. LibRedirect does NOT read
        the data in your clipboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/menus">menus</a>:
        To add LibRedirect buttons to the Context Menus:
        <br>
        <br>
        <div>
          <img class="align" src="./img/docs/context-menu.webp"
            alt="A screenshot of some buttons that are added to the context menu.">
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/bookmarks">bookmarks</a>
        (optional):
        To add the same Context Menus to Bookmarks too.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Match_patterns">all_urls</a>:
        The targets e.g <a href="https://youtube.com">youtube.com</a>,
        <a href="https://twitter.com">twitter.com</a> can be static,
        but the Switch Instance and Copy Raw buttons require access
        to the instances' urls which are custom to each user, and by so can't be static.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="where_the_hell_are_those_instances_coming_from">
      <a href="#where_the_hell_are_those_instances_coming_from">Where the hell are those instances coming from ?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Almost every frontend project has a list of public instances. Examples:
      <a href="https://api.invidious.io/">Invidious' official instances list</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances">Nitter's official instances list</a>. We fetch
      those lists using an automated
      <a href="https://github.com/libredirect/instances">python script</a>.
      This script gets triggered every single day. We don't intercept nor
      modify the lists outside of removing urls that are not valid (the
      structure is not that of a url). They are
      not our responsibility, they are the projects maintainers'.
    <p>Hence, If you are not comfortable with certain instances policies or found malicious instances then report it to
      the
      project maintainers to remove it from theirs. Then we will update the instances manually again to make sure those
      are removed which is only when you intimate us via our Matrix room or by Mastodon if the case is of high severity
      which will affect our users, if not please wait until the script fetches the instance automatically and remove
      them.</p>
    </p>
    <h3 id="chrome_web_store">
      <a href="#chrome_web_store">Chrome Web Store ?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      We can't publish it to the Chrome Web Store as it requires Manifest v3
      which removed essential features LibRedirect needs.
      You can still <a href="https://libredirect.github.io/download_chromium.html">install it manually</a> though.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are planning to adopt Manifest v3 in Firefox though as they will support
      the features LibRedirect needs. If other browsers adopt Mozilla's
      Manifest, then you might see LibRedirect in the Chrome Web Store.
    </p>

      <hr>
      <p>As of now, you can now install the extension in Firefox for Android like in Desktop. Just visit the <a
          href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/libredirect/">Mozilla addons page</a> and switch to Desktop
        view to install the extension. </p>
      <p>Even though, note that it is within Firefox browser only not for Android as a Whole.</p>
